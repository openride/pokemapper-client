    <h2>Pokemapper Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>Welcome to Pokemapper!  Pokemapper Inc. (“Pokemapper, “we”, “us”, or “our”) has prepared this privacy policy to describe to you our practices regarding the information we collect from users of the pokemapper.co website, as well as the Pokemapper mobile applications, and Pokemapper’s services offered through the website and mobile applications (collectively, “Pokemapper Service”). By visiting this website or by using the mobile applications or otherwise accessing or using the Pokemapper Service, you are agreeing to the collection and use of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with our information collection and use practices, please do not access or use the Pokemapper Service.</p>
    <p>The Pokemapper Service is not directed to children and children are not eligible to use the Pokemapper Service.  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  We do not collect or maintain personal information (i.e., information that allows someone to identify or contact an individual, including, for example, name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any other non-public information about an individual that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing information) from people we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website, mobile applications, or Pokemapper Service, is designed to attract people under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that user's personal information from our databases and to prevent the user from utilizing the Pokemapper Service.</p>
    <p>Pokemapper respects the rights of its users.  Pokemapper collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Statistical information gathered automatically when you access the Pokemapper Service through the website or mobile application.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Information Collected by Our Servers.  To make the Pokemapper Service more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, clickstream data, and a date/time stamp for your visit.</li>
          <li>Log Files.  As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ISP”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Website, track users’ movements around the Website, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor the Pokemapper Service to our users’ needs.  For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Pokemapper Service again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.</li>
          <li>Cookies.  Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information.  “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website.  We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Website.  This type of information is collected to make the Website more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Mobile Device. We may collect information about the computer or device you use to access the Pokemapper Service, including the hardware model, operating system and version, MAC address, unique device identifier, phone number, and mobile network information. In addition, the Pokemapper Service may access your device's image storage applications, with your consent, to facilitate your use of certain features of the Pokemapper Service. For more information about how you can control our access to these applications, please see "Your Choices" below.Information relating to your social networking or third-party accounts.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>We created interfaces that allow you to connect with other social networking websites including Facebook and Twitter (“Social Networking Sites”) through the Pokemapper Service, including as part of the registration process. We work with the Social Networking Site’s application protocol interface (better known as their developer API) in a way that allows you to authorize us to access your account on that Social Networking Site on your behalf.  In order to provide this authorization, you do not provide us with your user name or password to the Social Networking Site, but you will need to log-in to that Social Networking Site directly through the Pokemapper Service.  Once authorized by you, the Social Networking Site provides us a token that allows the Social Networking Site to recognize us when we ask, on your behalf, for access to your account information or to post information. For example, when you click “Connect” to grant Pokemapper access to your Facebook account, we will import your name, e-mail address, and profile photograph from Facebook, as well as other information. You can revoke our access to any Social Networking Site at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable Social Networking Site.</li>
